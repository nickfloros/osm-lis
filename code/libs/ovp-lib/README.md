Below is a segment of code that extracts a highway segment and nodes within 10m of a point
The script also extracts the segments (and nodes) before the after the previously identified segment

## Geometry
A good site to refresh o-lvel [geometry](https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/Geometry%20Concepts%20part%203:%20Using%20Geometry%20in%20Topcoder%20Problems#Satellites)

### lat,lng to 3d vectors
```
double x = sin(lng / 180 * PI) cos(lat / 180 PI) alt;
double y = cos(lng / 180 PI) cos(lat / 180 PI) alt;
double z = sin(lat / 180 PI) * alt;
```
where `alt` is earth radious
